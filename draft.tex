%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{}This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
See \texttt{mnras\_sample.tex} for a more complex example, and \texttt{mnras\_guide.tex}
for a full user guide.

All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work
in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field by \citet{Others2013},
and describes the problem the authors aim to solve \citep[e.g.][]{Author2012}.

\section{Data}

In this work we have considered haloes from two different catalogues:

\begin{description}
\item \textbf{The Millennium Simulation}: here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side
\item \textbf{The Millennium-XXL Simulation (MXXL)}: with a box side of 3 Gpc h$^{âˆ’1}$, it was especially tailored to study massive haloes which can be only found in very large volumes. It 
\end{description}

\begin{equation}
    x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
	\label{eq:quadratic}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Figures and tables}

Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't
worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the publishers.

Figures are referred to as e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:example_figure}, and tables as
e.g. Table~\ref{tab:example_table}.

% Example figure
\begin{figure}
	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example}
    \caption{This is an example figure. Captions appear below each figure.
	Give enough detail for the reader to understand what they're looking at,
	but leave detailed discussion to the main body of the text.}
    \label{fig:example_figure}
\end{figure}

% Example table
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{This is an example table. Captions appear above each table.
	Remember to define the quantities, symbols and units used.}
	\label{tab:example_table}
	\begin{tabular}{lccr} % four columns, alignment for each
		\hline
		A & B & C & D\\
		\hline
		1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
		2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\
		3 & 5 & 7 & 9\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section{Conclusions}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

% The best way to enter references is to use BibTeX:

%\bibliographystyle{mnras}
%\bibliography{example} % if your bibtex file is called example.bib


% Alternatively you could enter them by hand, like this:
